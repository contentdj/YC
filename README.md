Introduction
---
While starting on my YC application I found that there was no readily available
text version of the form. A few :%s/pattern//'s later, I had a cleaned up 
and easy to edit in vim version ready to go and thought "Why not share it with
the world?". This is the result. 

There are just weeks left to apply - will you?

Usage
---
If you're interested in following my own application, I would love your input.
Simply raise an issue [here](https://github.com/nickbarnwell/YC-/issues) or 
fork it and submit a pull request with your suggested improvements. You can 
be sure your patch will receive feedback.

For those who are entrepreneurially minded themselves, you don't want all the 
cruft from  my form. Simply fork, clone and

  `git checkout empty_app`

to start your own endeavour towards YC acceptance
