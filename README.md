Introduction
---
While starting on my YC application I found that there was no readily available
text version of the form. A few :%s/pattern//'s later, I had a cleaned up 
and easy to edit in vim version ready to go. 

There are just weeks left to apply - will you?

Usage
---
Since I'm using this repo to track my own progress, you probably don't want
all the baggage of my form. Simply fork, clone and

  `git checkout empty_form`

and start comitting your own changes
