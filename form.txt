YC usernames of all founders, including you, #{hn_user}, separated by spaces.
(That's **usernames**, not given names: "bksmith," not "Bob Smith." If there
are 3 founders, there should be 3 tokens in this answer.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YC usernames of all founders, including you, #{hn_user}, who will live in the
Bay Area June through August if we fund you. (Again, that's usernames, not

What is your company going to make?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Opsving removes the stress from food journaling for eating disorder patients
in recovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If this application is a response to a YC RFS, which one?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each founder, please list: YC username; name; age; year of graduation,
school, degree and subject for each degree; email address; personal url,
github url, facebook id, twitter id; employer and title (if any) at last job
before this startup. Put unfinished degrees in parens. List the main contact
first. Separate founders with blank lines. Put an asterisk before the name of
anyone **not** able to move to the Bay Area.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other
than this startup that each founder has built or achieved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a developer at Podio, I had the opportunity to write code that is now in use
daily by the BBC, Twitter, BMW, Alcatel-Lucent, and many others. I would
like to think few 18 year olds can say that. #TODO: Sounds too hubris-y
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please tell us about the time you, #{hn_user}, most successfully hacked some
(non-computer) system to your advantage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My best hack was recruiting at Podio - uncredentialed, unproven, and 
freshly laid off from my first "real startup" (at 17) I attended a
Hackathon they were hosting, volunteered to lead a team, and impressed their
developers enough to secure a position. My six months there were
an integral part of my development as both a programmer and entrepreneur,
and I will never regret the bout of hubris that lead me to it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or
work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.
How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any
of the founders not met in person?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A wicked fun  project I worked on with (potential cofounders) was SpunBy.me - a
web app that lets users crowdsource DJing their event. Partygoers scan a QR
code or visit a per-event URL and were presented with a YouTube search bar
and the current queue of songs. They can add new items or vote on the existing
ones, and the "best" song plays next. 

And we built it in 24 hours too
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this
area? How do you know people need what you're making?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have experienced first-hand the damage eating disorders cause, reflected in 
the anguish of some of those dearest to me, and the long road to recovery
faced by those just out of the darkest stages. If I could ease that suffering
one iota, for just one person, it would be worth every ounce of the 
blood, sweat, and tears I will put in to realise that vision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to
because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The market is saturated with diet aids for the fitness-obsessed, the runner
training for their first marathon, and the average person just looking to look
nicer at the beach. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors?
Who do you fear most?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just
don't get?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do or will you make money? How much could you make? (We realize you can't
know precisely, but give your best estimate.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and
how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you
launched? If so, how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If so, how
much? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate
(in users or revenue or both)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have an online demo, what's the url? (Please don't password protect it;
just use an obscure url.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg
problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of
users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you
overcome that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're already incorporated, when were you? Who are the shareholders and
what percent does each own? If you've had funding, how much, at what
valuation(s)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're not incorporated yet, please list the percent of the company you plan
to give each founder, and anyone else you plan to give stock to. (This question
is as much for you as us.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we fund you, which of the founders will commit to working exclusively
(no school, no other jobs) on this project for the next year?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For founders who can't, why not? What level of commitment are they willing to make?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do any founders have other commitments between June and August 2012 inclusive?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g. finishing college, going
to grad school), and if so what?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property
agreements that overlap with your project? Will any be working as employees or
consultants for anyone else?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders? If so,
how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok of course.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are any of the following true?
  (a) You are the only founder.
  (b) You are a student who may return to school when the next term starts.
  (c) Half or more of your group can't move to the Bay Area.
  (d) One or more founders will keep their current jobs.
  (e) None of the founders are programmers.

(Answering yes doesn't disqualify you. It's just to remind us to check.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One
may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do
something they list here and not in the main application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
(The answer need not be related to your project.)
